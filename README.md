# Micral R2E Portal CCMC

Why spend valuable time on a weird French luggable computer designed for accountants?

Excellent question! Well, I have bought one, and it doesn't work, so it is important to understand its details to restore the machine is an good state.

Also, I intend to write code for the portal (like a debug ROM) and interoperate with it, so understanding its hardware is a must.
