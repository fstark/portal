# General

There is a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(computer)) of questionable accuracy:
* Not the first portable computer.
  See MCM/70, IBM 5100, Scrib, Sharp PC-1211, Scrib, Xerox NoteTaker, Findex, HP-85 (yes, it's as portable as the Portal and marketed as such)...
  And that's excluding mostly unknown very low production & one-off machines.
  We could even stretch the definition as the Rockwell AIM-65 is functionally identical to the Portal, just without a handle
* Several hundreds seem to go against the serial numbers of 2000+, unless there was a S/N bump with each major revision. To be confirmed with more S/N data
* Some ramblings about the link to the Micral N to ramp up value.
* "Extremely rare" oops we have two, soon three in the same room.
* The OS is Prologue. BAL is **not** an OS, it's a programming language

It appears the Wikipedia page was written by the seller/auctionneer in order to inflate the value.

Analysis findings:
** [hardware](hardware.md): Hardware specs, details and datasheets
** [findings](findings.md): Software reverse-engineering and some history
** [filesystem](filesystem.md): Anatomy of the floppy disks & Prologue filesystem
** [machines](machines.md): List of known machines and their revisions
See the [findings](findings.md) document.

The following two French books are a very good resource for the Prologue operating system:
