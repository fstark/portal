Original price seems to be 35000FF, as seen in L'Ordinateur Individuel #50bis

## Variations

We count 4 versions of the machine

### Prototype

Only seen in SICOB 1980 pictures. Top shell in one piece, attached handle. Does not appear to have a protective cover. Main line display is only visible from the front. Printer feed button is next to the screen.

L'Ordinateur Individuel lists the following features:
* 15000 FF retail price
* 16k RAM
* Single sided double density floppy drive
* 40 column thermal printer
* 7 kg

Another SICOB report mentions 8.5kg.

### V0

Seen in the first ads. Printer feed button is a keyboard key next to the screen. Canon floppy drive with a fullsize door.

It appears the screen is more inclined and has a better viewing angle, but it might be obstructed by the cover angle...

12kg in the brochure

### V1

Black bezel around floppy. Olivetti floppy drive

### V2

Most common, design is the most refined. The chasis pieces are all different from V1 but still very similar: the top white part holding hinges are now plastic and mating in the back PSU cover.

## Other notes

Someone was selling one in classified ads in 1983 in Micro Syst√®mes #28 (1983/02)
