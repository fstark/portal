## 2024-11-16

* Alto replaced all tantalums, machine doesn't boot (but sometimes [displays a 3](../images/boot0.jpg))

* Wrote a simple debug rom based on disassembly

* Alto made a hellish hack to connect 2716 to 2764

* Made a custom rom [that display "PORTAL"](../images/boot1.jpg)

* Created a [debug ROM](../roms/debug.asm) for next session (display test/keyboard test/ram test)

* Floppy does not seek to track zero. Reading look flacky. Alto took it to give it some love.
